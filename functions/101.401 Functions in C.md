functions are "blocks" of code that is separated from the rest of the program and performs a specific logical task
`int main (Function parameters){}`
the **function parameters** are arguments given to your function to make it do stuff 
speaker notes that the compiler looks for the main function

 //return_type name (parameter list) {..code..}
```
